        <h1>MICK AND RORTY ON A FUCKIN' PICKLE ADVENTURE</h1>
        <p>RORTY. Rorty this hangover is fucking WICKED mate, fuck. </p>
        <p>Shit. Rorty. You seen my pickle? NO fuck not like that ya cheeky little fuck my fucking PICKLE.</p>
        <p>.</p>
        <p>.</p>
        <p>Fuck, musta lost it in the park last night while I was on a space-booze bender. Shit. Rorty, my head's fucked mate I can't be seen in public. Do you know how to navigate spacetime Rorty? 'Course ya don't because I'm smart and you're not. Fuck it. Here's what you gotta do:</p>
        <p>Learn string theory. What's that? You're not a physicist? Well, fuck, you can borrow my STRING THEORY from last night, it should be by my bucket of chocolate anyway. There's also a TIME COMPASS there. Take them both, you'll need em.</p>
        <p>Alright, listen up Rorty, here's what you need to do to navigate spacetime using string theory and a time compass</p>
        <p>
            <ol>
                <li>Start at the hatch to my underground lab over in the park, Rorty. It's labelled with a big "M" for "MICK", can't miss it</li>
                <li>Take the list of instructions and follow the jump sequence. What list? Fuck, we'll get to that later.</li>
                <li>You always move in exact multiples of the *BUUURP* length of one string theory, Rorty</li>
                <li>The direction you go in is one of the directions on your time compass. Always keep 12:00 facing the direction you're walking. Only turn when you reach the end of the jump, and turn towards the time-direction of the next jump.</li>
            </ol>
        </p>
        <p>Now, Rorty, I was pissed as all fuck last night so I only remember the first couple of jumps in the jump sequence. You'll have to find the rest along the way, but when I'm pissed as all fuck I tend to write things down so there should be enough evidence. Once you've got to the end, I bet ol' Mick left himself a clue as to where he put his pickle, eh? Oh? You want payment? Well, tell me where my pickle is and you can have my chocolate stash Rorty. Now GET AT IT! Also, string theory and spacetime are fairly convoluted in this part of the universe, if you don't immediately find the next jump sequence just remember which direction you were facing and have a quick look around, the evidence should be close by.</p>
        <p>Here's the first jump co-ordinates:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>
                At entrance to underground lab, facing the nearest tree
            </li>
            <li>Direction 2, 3 strings</li>
            <li>Direction 10, 1 string</li>
        </ol>
